Brief Summary of how Copilot Assisted in the Development Process:

For me, Copilot was very helpful in quickly creating the overall structure of various parts of the code. 
It assisted in writing structure anywhere from html to code blocks within Blazor components. Copilot was 
also very useful for finding and fixing errors in my code. If something wasn't working right I could just
show Copilot some of my code and explain the error I was getting. Within seconds Copilot would have a working
solution that I was able to integrate and fix my errors. Some issues took a little bit of back and forth chatting
with Copilot to resolve, but without Copilot it would have taken a lot longer to figure certain things out, so I
for one am very glad Copilot is there to help!
